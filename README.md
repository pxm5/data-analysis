## Data Analysis CLI Tool
This is a simple tool that runs in your terminal. It provides features for data analysis like plotting, data descriptions, etc. It also has various tools that are helpful for cleaning data without having to code anything.

I will keep adding more features as time goes on, the end goal is to make it a comprehensive tool that will ensure you wont have to write a single line of code for data exploration.
