## Data Analysis CLI Tool:
This is a simple tool that runs in your terminal. It provides features for data analysis like plotting, data descriptions, etc. It also has various tools that are helpful for cleaning data without having to code anything.

I will keep adding more features as time goes on, the end goal is to make it a comprehensive tool that will ensure you wont have to write a single line of code for data exploration.

## Installation guide:
Just go to releases, download the wheel (.whl) file and then run `pip install <path>`. Then, on any terminal, run `data-cli ` and it should work.
